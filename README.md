# 🛡️ Security Check — DEPRECATED

> ## ⚠️ This repo is deprecated and will be archived
>
> **Why:** Security Check was a UI-only heuristic report, not a real Home
> Assistant security audit. It did not query Home Assistant security state or
> validate findings server-side, so the tool could create misleading security
> signals.
>
> **HACS status:** [PR #6362](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/6362) was
> closed by HACS reviewers. This repository will not be resubmitted.
>
> **What to use instead:** use Home Assistant's built-in security guidance,
> review integrations and long-lived access tokens directly in HA settings, and
> rely on upstream HA documentation for hardening steps.
>
> Existing installs will continue to work as-is, but no further updates will be
> published.
